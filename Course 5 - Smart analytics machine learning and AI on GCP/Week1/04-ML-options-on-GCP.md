## Machine Learning options on Google Cloud Platform

### The GCP machine learning spectrum

Different options exist when it comes to leveraging machine learning

1. **ML Frameworks**
    - Advanced users who want more control over the building and training of their ML models will use tools that offer the levels of flexibility that they're looking for
    - This can involve developing custom models through an ML library, like TensorFlow, that's supported on the **AI Platform**
    - This option works well for data scientists with the skills and the need to create a custom TensorFlow model
2. **Cloud AutoML**
    - Google also makes the power of machine learning available to you even if you have a limited knowledge of machine learning
    - With Cloud AutoML, you can build on Google's machine learning capabilities to create your own custom machine learning models that are tailored to your specific business needs
    - These models can then be integrated into applications and websites, all without running a line of TensorFlow code
3. **Pre-trained ML models**
    - Alternatively, Google has a range of pre-trained models which don't require you to bring your own data
    - These are ML models that are ready for immediate use within applications in ways that the respective APIs are designed to support
    - Such pre-trained models are excellent ways to replace user input with machine learning
