### Solution /Rationale

In this case you would use a connector. Dimensions describe and group data, so they have the effect of segmenting the report. However, Data Studio includes a feature called Segments, which is set separately for using Google Analytics segments.

- <font color="lightgreen">**B** is correct, because there is no need to export; you can use the existing YouTube data source. Country code is a dimension because it's a string and should be displayed as such, that is, showing all countries, instead of filteringÂ </font>
- **A** is not correct because you cannot produce a summarised report that meets your business requirements using the options listed
- **C** and **D** are not correct because you do not need to export data from YouTube to Cloud Storage; you can simply use the existing YouTube data source.
